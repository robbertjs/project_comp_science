The notebook itself can be either run through jupyter notebook or if you do not have jupyter installed you can run it through deepnote. go to deepnote.com for further instructions.

The attached picture is of an action potential that fired 3 times. When running the model the potential has to fire at least once but it can fire more than once during the run. So it is possible that your picture does not fully resemble ours, you could have more or less action potentials fired. Just check that it fires at least once. The green vertical lines are an extra indication that the potential has fired. 

If any problems occur or you have any other questions, feel free to contact us through this email: robbertsierhuis@gmail.com
